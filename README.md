# Sales-Profit_Analysis_Dashboard_with_PowerBI
The project focuses on Atliq Hardware's downward sales trends in India and the main Goal is to create 3 interactive Dashboards with Power BI that allows data-driven decision-making process.

**Tool used:** 1. MySQL Workbench   2. Power BI

Here are the queries that I wrote to explore the data before building my Dashboards, then validating them: https://github.com/tanngnle/Sales-Profit_Analysis_Dashboard_with_PowerBI/blob/main/Sales_insights_MySQL_queries.sql

Here is my data star schema: <img src=”https://github.com/tanngnle/Sales-Profit_Analysis_Dashboard_with_PowerBI/blob/main/Data%20Star%20Schema.png”> 

Here are the Questions I answered to build 3 dashboards 
The first Dashboard consists of the key insights:
1. Revenue by markets.
2. Sales quantity by markets.
3. Revenue broken down by years and months.
4. Show me the top 5 customers by revenue.
5. Top 5 products by revenue number.
6. Total revenue.
7. Sale quantity.

The second Dashboard analyzes the profit:
1. Revenue Contribution by Markets and Customers
2. Profit Contribution by Markets and Customers
3. Profit margin (in percent) by Markets and Customers
Dashboard 2 output: <img src=”https://github.com/tanngnle/Sales-Profit_Analysis_Dashboard_with_PowerBI/blob/main/Dashboard%202%20Profit%20Analysis.png”> 

The third Dashboard analyzes the performance given a profit margin target of 2%:
1. Profit margin (in percent) in 4 levels of hierarchies (Zones, Markets, Customers, Product)
2. Comparison between Last year's monthly Revenue and this Year’s
